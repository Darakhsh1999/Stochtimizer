# Stochtimizer
Stochastic Optimization Library with;
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Linear Genetic Programming (LGP)

---

The workflow is inspired from scikit-learn. Create an object instance of the algorithmand pass a lambda objective function that you want to minimize. Call .fit() on object to start optimization process.
